Approach problems with this mindset to find practical solutions without undue stress.\n\n3. **Tragedy of the Commons**:\n   - Though more applicable in community resource scenarios, consider respecting and understanding the societal norms and communal resources in Australia. Integrating positively into the community can help maintain collective well-being.\n\n**Relevant Cases**:\n- **Cuban Missile Crisis (linked to Hanlon's Razor)**: Misunderstandings can lead to unnecessary escalation. In immigration scenarios, misunderstandings with authorities can be smoothed out by clear, patient communication, reducing undue stress on both sides.\n\n**Actionable Advice**:\n- **Research Thoroughly**: Use first principles thinking to dissect the immigration requirements and procedures.
